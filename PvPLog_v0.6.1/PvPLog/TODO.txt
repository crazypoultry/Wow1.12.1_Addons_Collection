TODO

1. Fix Feign Death bug.
2. Implement tabs for the PvP and duel stats windows.
3. Open the PvP stats window when the minimap button is clicked.
4. Open the duel stats window when the minimap button is control (or shift?) clicked.  (Need to research how to acheive this with the MyMinimapButton library.)
4. Further research the interrealm PvP data.
5. ???
