<div class="h">1. What is Doctor Druid?</div>
It´s a comprehensive set of commands which ie. automatically choose the rank for a healing spell of buff. The built-in Innervate-function won´t innervate classes that don´t use Mana at all. Different feral attacks have been unified to very few kews. And even more!
<br><br>
First of all, the author of this addon wants to minimize the amount of necessary key bindings without reducing the druids actual functionality.

<div class="h">2. Installation</div>
1. Unpack/move folder "DoctorDruid" to "World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns".<br>
2. Usually this addon should be automatically active. In case it is not: Start WoW, get to your list of characters and click at "AddOns" in the left bottom corner. There you can activate "Doctor Druid". 

<div class="h">3. How to use Doctor Druid?</div>
There are two ways to use the function this addon provides. The built-in way is to bind keys to its functions the same way you would bind keys for movement and so on.<br><br>
But the keys you bound to DoctorDruid´s functions this way won´t be available for any other functions when you shifted into cat form or bear form. Because of this it´s probably a good idea to create macros(, choose some nice icons) and copy and paste one of the commands listed below this section. Move these macros to your main hotbar, for this bar is going to change when shifting into cat/bear form.

<tr><td class="b1">09-29-2006 - v1.1.9:</td><td class="b2">
<div class="L1">- Fixed a bug that occured when trying to open the setup window with a bound key.</div>
</td></tr><tr><td class="ba2" /></tr>

<tr><td class="b1">09-25-2006 - v1.1.8:</td><td class="b2">
<div class="L1">- Some totems still are not listed as creature-type "Totem", but they´ll now be detected as well. While in Bear form or Cat form, detected totems won´t anymore be attacked with Faerie Fire or Demoralizing Roar.</div>
<div class="L2">- Cat and Bear form settings seperately got a new option which, if activated, will target a targets target (like /assist) if your current target is friendly and its target is an enemy.</div>
<div class="L1">- If free casting is active, Bear keys (1, 2 and 4) will now always use a damage dealing action, since they generate more aggro on their targets than other options (like Demoralizing Roar) would do. Some more internal code of how these keys actually work has been changed, in order to prevent the problem of not using any attack at your enemy if there was a silence effect active on you.</div>
<div class="L2">- For displaying cooldowns of Innervate an Resurrection there are now anti-spam-filters, which only allow you to post cooldown of each spell once every 3 seconds - now you can push these keys often, knowing you won´t spam your whole raid. :-)</div>
<div class="L1">- Since patch 1.12 it´s become very difficult to use distance checks of WoW in a useful way with certain abilities. Because of this, the way how Bear key 3 works has been changed very much, so functions you allow it to use won´t block each other, since all of them could be activated simultaneously in certain situations.</div>
<div class="L2">- When using healing spells, it will now display lowest and highest amount of healing this spell would actually do - before this version, it just displayed an average healing value of the used rank. If you´re using BonusScanner, healing bonuses will be taken into account.</div>

<tr><td class="b1">08-30-2006 - v1.1.7:</td><td class="b2">
<div class="L1">- Interface version changed to 11200.</div>
<div class="L2">- Fixed a bug, where purging of poison or curses didn´t work, when there were several debuffs on the target.</div>
<div class="L1">- Totem-moonfire works again.</div>
<div class="L2">- How often did I say Innervate (with raid-notice) now works as I wanted it to? It shouldn´t whisper to yourself, but should notice groups/raids if you´re innervating someone. I hope it does now work this way. ;-)</div>
</td></tr><tr><td class="ba2" /></tr>

<tr><td class="b1">08-22-2006 - v1.1.6:</td><td class="b2">
<div class="L1">- Corrected some wrong ReadMe-sentences in the German ReadMe.</div>
<div class="L2">- Bear key 4 (/dd bear4) won´t anymore display "test" in your message-window everytime it casts Faerie Fire.</div>
<div class="L1">- Cooldowns for Innervate will now also be displayed to group/raid if you don´t currently have a friendly target.</div>
<div class="L2">- A small locking mechanism has been implemented to Bear key 4, in order to stop that spamming of Demoralizing Roar in some situations, meaning there has been nearly no damage by Swipe in these situations. There´s now always a balance between Demoralizing Roar and Maul/Swipe.</div>
<div class="L1">- The setting for maximum healing over time (/dd maxheal) is now being saved when you log off.</div>
<div class="L2">- You may now determine in settings whether or not druids are being innervated while they´re in Bear-Form or Cat-Form.</div>
<div class="L1">- If your current target just got a new target, Bear keys 1/2/4 would just taunt it back to you. But now there´s a new setting that determines if this also happens if target´s new target is a Warrior. (They need rage as bears do!)</div>
<div class="L2">- Fixed a really silly bug with English localization: I forgot to copy two lines to the English localization file, thus all strings above these two lines were in wrong positions. Where the string from line 201 should be output, line 203 was printed, and so on.</div>
</td></tr><tr><td class="ba2" /></tr>

<tr><td class="b1">08-15-2006 - v1.1.5:</td><td class="b2">
<div class="L1">- If you´re silenced while in bear form in a moment where your bear-keys would like to cast Feral Faerie Fire, they won´t anymore try to cast normal Faerie Fire anymore.</div>
<div class="L2">- Accuracy of the formula used to approximate how long a fight will most probably take in Cat-Form has been increased a little - not much though.</div>
<div class="L1">- Fixed a bug where Rejuvenation used the maximum rank, when Free Cast is active, even if the targets´ level is too low for that rank of Rejuvenation.</div>
<div class="L2">- Since you can´t use Faerie Fire in Travel-Form and Aquatic Form, the function /dd faeriefire has been reduced a little, so you won´t anymore get error messages when trying to fire someone while you´re in one of these forms.</div>
<div class="L1">- New function: /dd bear4 will do most Aggro on most mobs at the same time. You just have to change your target often, in order to get enough Aggro on any mob of the current mob-group.</div>
<div class="L2">- New function: /dd bearexchange will exchange Bear keys 2 and 4. You can also do this in your Bear settings, but they function will just do it faster.</div>
<div class="L1">- The key used to shapeshift you into a Bear may now also get a second function optionally, which can be determined in your Bear settings.</div>
<div class="L2">- In your Cat settings you may now choose whether or not Rake should be tried if there´s not enough Energy left for Claw. Since Rake needs less Energy than Claw - there´s always a difference of 5 Energy points - this may get you a combopoint where you´d usually have to wait until the next tick.</div>

<tr><td class="b1">08-10-2006 - v1.1.4:</td><td class="b2">
<div class="L1">- A huge error has been fixed. After updating DoctorDruid, it has sometimes been responsible for new settings not being saved. Sometimes this got even worse, meaning no changed settings were saved at all. In order to prevent any incompatibilities connected to this bug, this version causes your DoctorDruid-settings to be reset to their defaults.

<div class="L1">- The function used for prowling (/dd catmulti or /dd catmulti2) is also able to do an opener or a finishing move. Until now the opener was Pounce and the finisher was Ferocious Bite - but this can now be changed in setup.</div>
<div class="L2">- The function used to shift into Cat-Form may now optionally be used to "Track Humanoids" or "Prowl" (or nothing) on second activation.</div>
<div class="L1">- The amount of life a mob must have in order to have this addon cast Feral Faerie Fire or Demoralizing Roar will now be determined dynamically. Outside of Instances the difference of yours and your target´s level will do this, while inside Instances the difference of your level and the level of the Instance will be used for this. For Boss mobs, it will still be lower, since they used to have more health than normal or elite mobs.</div>
<div class="L2">- A compatibility issue with an other Druid addon (concerning shapeshifting) has been fixed.</div>
<div class="L1">- In case you press your Innervate-key (with a notice) several times, there will be no more whisper/group/raid-spam for the first 5 seconds after the actual Innervate. When those 5 seconds are over, notices are active again. Though you will always see these "spam"-messages locally, if you push the Innervate-key several times, others will not.</div>
<div class="L2">- Some small bugs concerning cat attacks with very specific settings have been fixed.</div>
<div class="L1">- Since most Elementals are immune to damage over time, the automatically chosen finisher in Cat-Form will now always be Ferocious Bite when target is an Elemental. If you also chose "Both" normal cat-attacks, then there will be no more Rake against Elementals - only Claw.</div>
<div class="L2">- New function: Rebirth. Rank is being chosen dynamically. Outside combats the lowest (and thus cheapest) rank will be used, while for combat Rebirth the highest possible rank is going to be casted. In case you don´t possess a required reagent, it will try other ranks as well, in order to do the cheapest possible Rebirth (outside combats) or the most efficient Rebirth (while fighting).</div>

<div class="L1">- A new function has been implemented, which is able to just deactivate Prowling (in Cat form) or the nightelf-stealth-ability. This function will not activate those, just deactivate them.</div>
<div class="L2">- There´s now a second cat-multikey, which is almost the same as the old one. Difference is, if you´ve been prowling for more than 3 seconds and push the key while you don´t have any target, it will stop prowling.</div>
<div class="L1">- If Healing Touch Rank 1 makes it into the Top9 of your healing statistics, its required time will now be shown as well.</div>
<div class="L2">- Changed logic of one condition that casts Tiger's Fury. It won´t be casted in short fights anymore, which would probably cost you valuable combo-points if it did. Instead it will be casted periodically and more predictably in fights that will take much time (ie. Boss fights).</div>
<div class="L1">- If you´re out of combat range to a mob and if that mob is not currently fighting, you may now use your keys for cat-infront-attacks (/dd catinfront and /dd catinfront+) for pulling a mob with Feral Faerie Fire.</div>

<div class="L2">- The cat-ability "Track Humanoids" now has an "s" at its end, so it will really be casted on English WoW-clients.</div>
<div class="L1">- Until now, mob who is running away has been taunted in Bear form, because the AddOn thought the mob now has another target. An additional check has been implemented to see if the target still has a target - if it doesn´t, it´s running away and thus won´t anymore be taunted.</div>

<div class="L1">- Tiger's Fury may now also be used with Finishing-Moves.</div>
<div class="L2">- Added click-buttons to deactivate automated Tiger's Fury when fighting against other players. Configurable for Fury+Opener as well as Fury+Finisher.</div>
<div class="L1">- The bear attack key for single targets will now try a Demoralizing Roar before trying Taunt as last ability (in case all other abilities have cooldowns or aren´t required).</div>
<div class="L2">- Taunt and Challenging Roar won´t be used in PvP anymore.</div>
<div class="L1">- Another new feature requires BonusScanner to work - without BonusScanner it won´t be available at all. When clicking at "Statistics" (only visible if BonusScanner is active) in setup (/dd), you get to a little interface able to calculate your 9 most efficient healing spells, based upon some attributes of yours. It determines how much life you could heal with each before you´re finally out of Mana. That´s based on a simple low-performance formula that first calculates the top-table based on healing power of all spells and afterwards adds the influences of mana-regeneration per 5 seconds. This way some Rejuvenation spells with extremely high healing values (even higher than the top listed healing spell) will be found somewhere within the list. But since these spells would be needing upto several days(!) to finish their healing, this addon´s author decided not to move them to the top of the list.</div>

<div class="L2">- New function implemented to start prowling when in cat form. If you press the key bound to this function again, you´re not going to stop prowling, which is the advantage of this function in case you press the prowling-key several times, for whatever reason. (Probably there´s a technical problem with your keyboard - or you want to start prowling as fast as possible and thus you hit your prowl-key as often as possible.) If you´re behind an enemy target and activate this function, Pounce (the opener with a short stun) is being casted. If you activate this function while in combat, "Ferocious Bite" (instant damage finisher) is being casted.</div>
<div class="L1">- Keys for shape-shifting won´t terminate your current form. This way you can push a shapeshifting-key several times to shift as fast as possible (while there´s still a global cooldown). Now if you had only one form, you couldn´t go back to your caster form. Because of this, another function has been implemented which gets you back to your caster form from any possible druid form.</div>
<div class="L2">- Implemented keys to be able to cast Healing Touch and Regrowth without any increasing of ranks. This way you can also heal people without Aggro (thus not getting any damage) - you just have to push the right button. ;)</div>

Thanks to all those people who started writing small macros with great potential.<br>
Many thanks to Srand - author of FeralFighter - for writing such a great addon.<br>
And many many thanks for feedback from you WoW gamers who are actually using Doctor Druid. Several bugs would never have been fixed without your help.<br>
