1) Added toggle keybind

v0.81 --> v0.83

1) Added myAddOns
2) Fixed Gender Issues
3) Added a few new emotes

v0.80 --> v0.81
 + Emotion
1. Added "Emotion"!  (T_T )\(-_- ) \(^o^)/ (O_O;) ( =_=)

"Emotion" is a unobtrusive and fully customizable bar of emotes

It's basically a completely new separate addon, but it uses 2 of the files that RPHelper uses and it does help in role playing, hence it does seem to fall under "Roleplaying Helper" so now it's included.

Toggle Emotion on/off by typing:  /es
Open the Emotion Options Menu by typing:  /es o
or by pressing the new "Emotion" button in the RPH config menu

If you want "Emotion" without "RPHelper" you can go to hell, I mean kindly download it from:
http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=3910

There is NO difference between the "Stand-alone" version of Emotion and the one in RPHelper.  However, if you want to know exactly what Emotion is, that page will tell you more about it.


2. Added many phrases by mythik.  mythik, I can't thank you enough.

3. Added RPs for:
	- You Level Up
	- Camp  (when you type /camp or click the "Logout" button outside of a city)



v0.77 --> v0.80
Added:  All Druid spells!

Added:  All Mage spells!

Added:  All Paladin spells!

Added:  All Priest spells!

That's ALL the classes spells finished \(^o^)/

Add/Fix:  Code for addons to emote is something like this: DoEmote( "laugh" )
However, I just found out that there are many emotes that do not work with this code!
Example:  In the game, you can type /doom /threat /threaten /wrath and all of them will emote something like, "You threaten (Target) with the wrath of doom."
However, DoEmote( "doom" ); DoEmote( "threat" ); DoEmote( "wrath" ) do NOTHING f(-_-;)
Only DoEmote( "threaten" ) works.
If the "clone" emote got picked, RPHelper would think you've just RPed but nothing was emoted.
So I added a list of the emotes and their clones, so that you can use the full list at: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/emotes.html
 and RPHelper will replace the "clones" with the "real" emotes.
Useless fact: Aside from the emotes without clones, there are 37 other "real" emotes that have 1-3 "clones" each.


Fixed:  "emote SELF"  It was ignoring them like the "clone" emotes  *sh('o' )cked*

Big replacement (for me at least):  "Events" menu with all new menu similar to "Spells" menu.
- This will make it a lot easier to add events, as a HUGE part of it before was updating the menu.
- Events are no longer grouped, which will allow you to set Delays & Chances for EVERY event that is in your customizable files.
- Things that are not relevant to your CLASS such as "Pet Attack" or "You Heal" are automatically removed (Priests should be the only ones with both)
- Just like the "Spells" window, if you do not have any RPs for a certain event in the "Phrase Lists" that you're using, that event will be faded with no Delay or Chance, or you can choose to not show them at all.

Added:  Before, if you unchecked your CLASS from the "Phrase Lists" menu, RPHelper wouldn't look at RPWORDLIST.event.YOURCLASS anymore.  But all of your spell RPs are marked with YOURCLASS so they would stop working too.  Now, if you uncheck your class, a new checkbutton will appear which will allow you to decide if you still want to use your spell RPs.

Added:  A number of RPs that were written by mithyk.  Also edited & took out a few RPs because of good suggestions and points he made.

Added:  If you use RINSULT! in the customizable files, the period in the random insult will be replaced by the exclamation mark.

Added:  Some words in the "Events" and "Spells" window to guide people if they have no "Events" or "Spells" available with RPs.



v0.76 --> v0.77
Added:  All Shaman spells!

I tried something that might fix the "unfinished capture" error on French clients.
Please let me know if the error is still there.

Added:  Keywords
PLAYER_CLASS --> Your class  		(Example:  "Hunter")
TARGET_CLASS --> Your target's class  	(Example:  "Warlock")
PLAYER_GUILDNAME --> Your guild's name  (Example:  "The Alliance of Blahblah")
PLAYER_GUILDRANK --> Your guild rank	(Example:  "Knight")
TARGET_GUILDNAME --> Your target's guild's name	(Example:  "The Alliance of Blahblah")
TARGET_GUILDRANK --> Your target's guild rank	(Example:  "Footman")

Added:  Slash Commands for Hello & Goodbye RPs (taken from: talktonpc_beginning & talktonpc_end)
The same "Hello" RP can be accessed by typing any 1 of the following:
/rp h
/rp hi
/rp hello
The same "Goodbye" RP can be accessed by typing any 1 of the following:
/rp b
/rp by
/rp bye
/rp goodbye



v0.75 --> v0.76
Added:  Patch 1.10 compatibility  (Wasn't as easy as I thought it would be f(-_-;))

Added:  All Hunter Spells!

Added:  New "Spell" window in the menu.  This is where you can set Delays & Chances for any spells that your character knows and you have at least 1 RP in the customizable folder.  There are also options to set the window to view spell names for "All" spells, "All Known" spells (in your spellbook), "All (spells) with RPs" available in your customizable folders, & "Known (spells) with RPs"

Added:  "Use Current" & "Random" choice option between Blizzard languages for RP Language.

Added:  You can now change the words for first-time/beginning/middle/ending
 RPs when you talk to an NPC.

- The lists are in the ANY.lua file but there should be no problems if you wanted to copy/rename them for other traits.
RPWORDLIST.talktonpc_end.HUNTER = {}
RPWORDLIST.talktonpc_end.HUNTER.emote = { "BOW", "BYE", "THANK", }

Changed:  Renamed buttons in the Menu  
	- Advanced --> Events
	- RPLists --> Phrase Lists

Changed:  Minor changes to wordlists



v0.73 --> v0.75
Added:  All Warlock Spells!
Added:  All Warrior Spells!

(They currently share the "Delay" & "Chance" with Casting Spells.)
(Note: Menu will not be updated until patch 1.10, which will make some things I'd like to do a lot easier.)

Still having problems with "Next Melee" spells.
They will currently fire the RP event chance if cancelled.
So far RPHelper only supports 2 next melee spells for Warrior:  Heroic Strike & Cleave
Please either leave them blank for now or never cancel them (^_^)

Note:  There will be a chance to RP each time you do the spell, even if your spell doesn't hit.

Added:  You now can have multiple random phrases for an Event.
Simply add another random table to the file and add a number to the word random.
RPWORDLIST.hurt.WARRIOR.random = {}
RPWORDLIST.hurt.WARRIOR.random1 = {}

Actually you can add anything to the word random.
RPWORDLIST.hurt.WARRIOR.random42 = {}
RPWORDLIST.hurt.WARRIOR.random_number_two = {}
RPWORDLIST.hurt.WARRIOR.my_other_random = {}
RPWORDLIST.hurt.WARRIOR.pukingrandompoop = {}

As long as nothing else is changed and the word "random" (in lowercase) is found somewhere in that 4th word after the 3rd period, RPHelper will try to use it as a random phrase.  If 2 of these are exactly the same, the 2nd will overwrite the first.

This also works for "emote" and "customemote", though there really isn't much purpose to add another table for these.

Fixed:  CastSpellByname() function.  Many thanks to Luke1972 for finding and fixing this problem. 

Added:  Capitalization for the first word of a "Saying" or "Random Phrase".
So now "PTSP needs to die." --> "He needs to die." -not-> "he needs to die."

Fixed:  customemote in ANY.lua to "smiles at PP critical hit."  Was using old KEYWORD.  Thanks to Dagnome for pointing it out.

Changed:  INTRODUCE emote now has same chance to RP as Beginning or Ending conversation.
However, the name will still be added to the list of NPCs you've talked to so you will not introduce yourself again.

Fixed:  German "Ihr" to "Du" for Random Insults.
Added:  You now can change the word "You" in RInsult.lua and "Du" in RInsult.de.lua to anything you want.

Added:  A few Warrior & Warlock phrases


v0.71 --> v0.73
1.  KEYWORDS now work in EVERY saying, custom emote & random phrase
(except NPC, TEXT and LANG.  They are ONLY for when an NPC says something)
Added a few KEYWORDS as well

KEYWORDS include:
RINSULT:	Random insult

--==You==--
PLAYER:		Your name
SP:		Your Subject Pronoun    (he, she, it)
OP:		Your Object Pronoun     (him, her, it)
PP:		Your Possessive Pronoun (his, her, its) 

--==Your Target==--
(Careful! Your target rarely has anything to do with the event.)
(Ex: Your target might be a party member when you say something for getting hit.)
(This is probably only useful when you do a SPELL CAST.)

TARGET:		Your target's name
TSP:		Target's Subject Pronoun    (he, she, it)
TOP:		Target's Object Pronoun     (him, her, it)
TPP:		Target's Possessive Pronoun (his, her, its) 

--==Pets==--
PNAME:		Pet's Name
PTNAME:		Pet's Target's Name
PTSP:		Pet's Target's Subject Pronoun    (he, she, it)
PTOP:		Pet's Target's Object Pronoun     (him, her, it)
PTPP:		Pet's Target's Possessive Pronoun (his, her, its)

A phrase with a KEYWORD that can't be used (Ex: "Die TARGET!" when you have no target)
will not be considered when RPHelper chooses what phrase/emote to say/do.

2.  Capitalization:  Your phrases will now be capitalized after a period, exclamation mark or question mark.
	- This was put in because of the pronoun KEYWORDS
	- "I think TSP is bad.  TSP needs to die." --> "I think he is bad.  He needs to die."

3.  Fixed bug where a character would say a phrase meant for a friendly NPC to an enemy NPC

4.  The chance that a "random phrase" gets picked instead of a "saying", "emote", or "custom emote"
is now based on the number of combinations it can make.

Example (from Warlock's npctalksfriendly):
"BLANK BLANK BLANK"
BLANK #1 has 6 possibilities
BLANK #2 has 6 possibilities
BLANK #3 has 5 possibilities
6 * 6 * 5 = 180 combinations
180 combinations / 40 = 4.5 (40's an arbitrary number I picked that seems to work well)
Round 4.5 = 5  (if it rounds to 0, 0 will be changed to 1)
Result: 5 of these random phrases will be added to the sayings.

5.  Lot's of "under the hood" development on random phrases.


v0.70 --> v0.71
Added a "Language" button to the main menu.  Type:  /rp
Clicking on the button will switch between Common/Orcish and your native languages like Gnomish or Troll.
- This will not affect the language you speak in; only the language RPHelper uses to role play.

Changed an undead phrase for entering combat to the correct "Rend flesh with me!"  Thanks to Vamplil for pointing it out.


v0.60 --> v0.70
Added custom emotes!
- So if my custom emote was "eats some pudding.", everyone will see "Syrsa eats some pudding."

	(Other faction players will see something like, "Syrsa makes some strange gestures.")
	(Blizzard put this in to prevent cross-faction communication like emoting, "Syrsa says, Hi, how ya doin'?")

Added new RPs!
	- Spells with CAST TIMES  (Not instant or channeled spells)
		You will RP when you BEGIN CASTING
		Due to limitations, it's extremely difficult for an addon to catch instant & channeled spells, but I'm trying (^_^)
		Very nice for casters since you can now say incantations as you cast, 
		however for some of us warriors, we only have "Slam" f(-_-;)

	- You Heal another person

	- You Crit Heal another person

	- Friendly NPC talks
	- Enemy NPC talks
	(These replace the old "NPC talks" RP)
	(Note: You'll now hear the targeting sound when an NPC talks.  This is because the only way that I know of 
	to find out if an NPC is a friend or enemy is to target them & test if the target is friendly or an enemy, 
	then switch back to your previous target.  If you had no target, your target will become the NPC speaking.  
	It's not a "bug", it's a "feature" gosh darn it!
	You probably wouldn't even have realized if I hadn't said anything... )

Added native languages!
	You can change the language you RP in by typing any of the following during the game:
	/rp l
	/rp lang
	/rp language

Added the ability to "self" emote with Blizzard's emotes even when you have a target.
	- In the customizable files, you must type (space) SELF after Blizzard's emote word.
	- SELF must be in capital letters.
	- For example, if you have a target:  
	RPWORDLIST.entercombat.TAUREN.emote = "LAUGH SELF" --> "You laugh."
	RPWORDLIST.entercombat.TAUREN.emote = "LAUGH" --> "You laugh at (Target)."

Changed many chances and delays.
- Due to many new events, characters were getting noisier than intended.
- If you've used RPHelper before, you will only get the new chances & delays if you click "Reset Defaults" in the "Advanced" window.

Took out PET RPs from the customizable files for classes without pets.

Added new phrases throughout.  Many were suggestions from mithyk.

Added Shakespearean words to the random insult generator for Paladins.

Insults on non-English clients, should now say "You" in the correct language (not English).

General errors fixed, including: "RoleplayingHelper.lua:1062: bad argument#1 to 'getn' (table expected, got nil)"

PTPP is now listed as Pet's target's "possessive" pronoun instead of "personal" pronoun, to ease the hearts of the grammarians out there.


v0.50 --> v0.60
Added RPs for:
	- You Crit: When you give a critical hit from physical hits or spells with physical damage (ie: Raptor Strike)
	- You Crit (Spell): You give a critical hit using Arcane, Fire, Frost, Holy, Nature, or Shadow Damage. (Wands do this too)
	- Pet Dies: Poor guy...

The options you set will now SAVE for each individual character

Fixed the RPs when talking to an NPC.
	Some Opening, Middle, and Closing conversation windows wouldn't trigger the RP.
	It will now wait for 2 frames after a dialogue box closed to see if another opens.

Added Delay and Chance options for Talking to an NPC (Beginning & End) & (Middle)
	(So now you can set it so it won't spam.)

Quest Dialogue boxes now trigger the TalkToNPC RP

All customizable files are now in a folder called "English". ALL USERS EXCEPT GERMAN should use the "English" folder.

German users should use the folder called "Deutsch".

Events such as (Dodge, Parry, Pet Dies, etc.) should call RPs for any localization now.  Please let me know if it doesn't.

Added a few English Night Elf sayings

Fixed GUI Menu issues

Added X-Ray Goggles to GUI Menu


v0.40 --> v0.50 (Not released before due to many bugs & things not being quite the way I wanted)
GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (GUI) MENU FOR OPTIONS	
type:   /rp
3 parts:
	- Main Window:  On/Off, Timer showing when your last RP was, Advanced Button, RPLists Button
	- Advanced Window:  For setting Delays & Chances for each "Role Play" & a countdown showing how much time is left before an "RP" is available again.
		Delays = # of seconds.  If any RP happens, you have to wait this many seconds before this RP is available.
		Chances = % chance (after delay) of using this RP when an event occurs (ie: going into combat)
	- RPList Window:  For changing which lists that you're using to role play

	The coolest part for me, which very few will see and which took way to long to make, is in the Advanced Window.
	After you RP, the RPs name will turn from red to yellow to green while numbers countdown the delay.
	The Heading for the group of RPs will also change color based on the RPs under the heading.
	To see it, change the Delay to a very high number.
	Putting the chance to 0% also changes the RP name to red.

OTHER
Added options for All Combat RPs, All Non-Combat RPs, and All Anytime RPs to be grouped for delays and chances.


v0.32 --> v0.40
CUSTOMIZATION  \(^o^)/
- Added files where users can add their own phrases!
- Flexible in-game "traits" have been added to control those files
- Probably rewrote 75% of the code to allow for this.


v0.31 --> v0.32
MINOR BUG FIX
- (/rp t) should work for all classes now (not just warriors).  The bug was fixed but no words were changed.  Just something to keep in mind before your Human Priest says, "I'll eat your face off!"
- (/rp off) now turns everything off, as was intended.

v0.3 --> v0.31
MINOR BUG FIX
- You will no longer emote when channeling a spell (Emotes break channeling) Thanks to bATo for pointing out the problem and Syllani for giving a way to solve it.
- Removed "jock-strap" & "toilet full of" from the random insult generator and replaced "truckload of" with "wagonload of" in trying to keep with a WoW-era theme.
- the error: .../RoleplayingHelper.lua: 674: bad argument #1 to 'random' (interval is empty) has hopefully been fixed.
