Dear author of the original German fix, sorry but I couldnt reach you because i havent found your contact info. Please contact me so we can work together on a future version. 
------------------

Ive made an "unofficial advanced German fix" based on the tranlated files because a lot of sentences still werent translated ... especially undead and pet sentences.
Ive translated them and added a lot more sentences.
I hope you like them.

I will publish a newer version with more and better sentences from time to time.
If you have some suggestions for german sentences / events just get in touch with me.
Im only playing Horde chars. If you see a spelling mistake with an Ally char then please get in touch with me.
