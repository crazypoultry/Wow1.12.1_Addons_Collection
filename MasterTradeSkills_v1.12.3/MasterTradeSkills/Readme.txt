Notes from Triadian:
-------------------------
No idea why this mod slipped into non-existance, so i dragged it back kicking and screaming - if you wanna flame me for doing you will be ignored at Triadian@Gmail.com i will only be updating
at http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=2146 and http://www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-4773-master-trade-skills.html- so if you write a comment elsewhere i might not see it.

any nice suggestions or improvements let me know and i'll try and implement them but my knowledge of UI isn't that brilliant.
