CCWatch is a mod designed to show the durations of crowd control spells, debuffs and buffs ON YOUR ENEMY.
You can configure which CC/debuff/buffs to monitor, customize bar width, scale, growth mode, timer mode, etc.

It currently monitors most cc/debuffs/buffs of all classes in WoW, however, should you find anything missing, don't hesitate to inform me.

-For further explanation look at the screenshots.-



I did not originally program this addon...but the original author, Elwen/maniac91 stated that he won't be able to continue adding effects and developing it any further.
Someone needed to do it, so my main work in continuing this AddOn was to correct wrong durations and to complete the very incomplete database aswell as fix the German Localization.
Special Thanks go to Elwen/maniac91 for making this great mod and Vector- for giving the base mod(StunWatch)!!!
